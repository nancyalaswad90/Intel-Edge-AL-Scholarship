### What is AI at the Edge?


The edge means local (or near local) processing, as opposed to just anywhere in the cloud. This can be an actual local device like a smart refrigerator, or servers located as close as possible to the source (i.e. servers located in a nearby area instead of on the other side of the world).

The edge can be used where low latency is necessary, or where the network itself may not always be available. The use of it can come from a desire for real-time decision-making in certain applications.

Many applications with the cloud get data locally, send the data to the cloud, process it, and send it back. The edge means thereâ€™s no need to send to the cloud; it can often be more secure (depending on edge device security) and have less impact on a network. Edge AI algorithms can still be trained in the cloud, but get run at the edge.


###  Why is AI at the Edge Important?


Network communication can be expensive (bandwidth, power consumption, etc.) and sometimes impossible (think remote locations or during natural disasters)
Real-time processing is necessary for applications, like self-driving cars, that can't handle latency in making important decisions
Edge applications could be using personal data (like health data) that could be sensitive if sent to cloud
Optimization software, especially made for specific hardware, can help achieve great efficiency with edge AI models
